In this project which was of filtering The  data on various  checkboxes.

I have used the functional  programming for faster and reusable code and for
 the filtering I have used built in funvtion of the JavaScriptcause it reduces 
the  time on search ...causein theother way you have to  take two variables and 
keep track of it when the matches  and pass it  to the orignal variable of the 
loop to change the data on the view. Whereas the built in includes function 
do the same thing by searching for the data if it's present in an array.


Further more you can find the usable components which can be alteredin any 
way by just passinf props(in need)...

For the folder structure I like to keep my all  of the component login in the 
Component's Folder...where as for the business logic I  keep them in the 
container cause  there is, where you render the view for the user 

For the backend I have used Node,Express,Mongodb cause itsmuch faster
cause there is no relation involvedin it...And for the real time projects 
Node ismuch Faster....REST Api's arealso used just to  send and fetch data
Backend is based on MVC pattern...
Controller is the entry point of  the application
Modals have the  database  schema
